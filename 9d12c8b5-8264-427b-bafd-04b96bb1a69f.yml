      content: This project naievely estimate urban development index (UDI) for target areas of interest (AOI) over time, using satellite imagery and computer vision algorithms (Open CV). The project is targeted at improving the inefficiencies in local government agencies in tracking, and analyzing Urban Development Index within geolocations

      content: APPLICATION MAY BE UNSTABLE - This application is a development build for testing purposes only. It is not intended for production use, nor does it guarantee accuracy of the result.

      content: About this project

    - type: paragraph
      content: Project corpenicus was part of a prototyping effort to use OpenCV to find the difference between two satellite images over-time, and compute the pixel differences, as a rough representation of the development index of that geolocation. This prototype lacks advanced considerations such as image segmentation techniques to accurately identify structurs which are markers of urban development, such as highways, buildings, etc. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have ideas on improving this prototype

      content: Application Architecture

    - type: paragraph
      content: The application has three microservices; <strong>The User Interface</strong>, built in ReactJs. <strong>The Users Backend</strong> built with NodeJs and GraphQL - This was my first experimentation with a GraphQL backend, and I can perhaps conclude that GraphQL is not for me. <strong>The Image Differencing Microservice</strong> - This is the OpenCV service that stores the images and computes the differences; built in Python and Flask.
    - type: warning
      content: The Image Differencing API prototype does not have background processing built in, and the differencing algorithm is computed on the fly
