        Some of the topics we will cover include:
        - How to build APIs with Python, FastAPI, and WebSockets
        - How to build real-time systems with Redis
        - How to build a chat User Interface with React

        <p>
        Important Note: This is an intermediate full stack software development project that requires some basic Python and JavaScript knowledge.
        </p>
        </div>

        I've carefully divided the project into sections to ensure that you can easily select the phase that is important to you in case you do not wish to code the full application. You can download the full repository on [My Github here](https://github.com/stephensanwo/fullstack-ai-chatbot).

      title: Build a Fullstack AI Chatbot Part 2 - Chat Server
      description: In this section, we will build the chat server using FastAPI to communicate with the user. We will use WebSockets to ensure bi-directional communication between the client and server so that we can send responses to the user in real-time.
